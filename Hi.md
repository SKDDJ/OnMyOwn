# Hi, My Friend :hand:
> This is MY page.

But I didn't decide to display what on my page yet.
Maybe It will stay blank until I remember and have energy to fill it.

*I'm working hard to take my course notes with MarkDown and may share **them** someday.*

The followings are names of the courses:
* Economics
* Probability
* The Computer Composition
* The Computer Network


And I'm going to put some learning experience about code, study etc on GitHub.
Maybe some articles will be like:
* front
  * html,css,js
* backend
  * golang
  * python
