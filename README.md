# Hi, thereï¼Œ I'm Shiym :hand:


> This is my page.

However, I have not decided what to display on my page yet.
Maybe it will stay blank until I remember and have enough energy to deal with it.

I work hard to take my course notes with MarkDown and may share them someday.

In addition, I use Hexo to set my own blog here: shiym.top

All my notes and experience have been settled on this site.


Moreover, I am going to put some learning experience about code, study etc on GitHub.
For example, some articles will be like:
backend: Golang, Python...
DevOps: Docker...


Have a nice day! :smile:
