# Hi, My Friend :hand:

> This is MY page.

But I haven't decided to display what on my page yet.
Maybe It will stay blank until I remember and have energy to deal with it.

~~*I'm working hard to take my course notes with MarkDown and may share **them** someday.*~~

Well I use Hexo to set my own blog here: [shiym.top](https://shiym.top)

All my notes and experience have been settled this site.

The followings are names of some of the courses:
* 📘Economics
* 📝Probability
* 💻The Computer Composition
* 🖥️The Computer Network
* 🧬Data Structure and Algorithm


And I'm going to put some learning experience about code, study etc on GitHub.
Maybe some articles will be like:
* front
  * `html`,`css`,`js`
  * maybe I will try to touch `vue` or `react` when I can spare some time
* backend
  * golang
  * python


Have a nice day! :smile:
