> Welcome to my page.

I'm diligently taking course notes using Markdown, and I may share them in the future. By the way, my blog is hosted both on my server in CN and GitHub Pages, accessible at https://shiym.top. If you access the website through foreign proxies, it can speed up the access :)

Furthermore, I plan to share some learning experiences related to coding, studying, and more on my blog.

This site contains almost all my notes and experiences.

For instance, I'll write articles on topics like:
- Backend: Golang, Python...
- DevOps: Docker, GitLab CI/CD...

Wishing you a wonderful day! :smile:
