# Hi there, I'm Shiym! :wave:

> Welcome to my page.

However, I haven't made a decision yet on what to showcase here.
It might remain empty until I recall and gather enough energy to work on it.

I'm diligently taking course notes using Markdown, and I may share them in the future. (By the way, my blog is hosted both on my server in CN and GitHub Pages, accessible at http://shiym.top. If you access the website through foreign proxies, it can speed up the access.)

This site contains all my notes and experiences.

Furthermore, I plan to share some learning experiences related to coding, studying, and more on GitHub.
For instance, I'll write articles on topics like:
- Backend: Golang, Python...
- DevOps: Docker...

Wishing you a wonderful day! :smile:
